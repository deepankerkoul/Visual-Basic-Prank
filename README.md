# Visual-Basic-Prank
A simple VB application that consumes system resources for a while before shutting down on its own (intended as a prank).

I developed this application as a prank during my school time to fool my younger brother into opening the application (which had a tempting icon for a 10 year old kid) that would use up system resources and waste his allotted time for playing on the computer. 

The application was developed in Visual Basic language using the Visual Basic 6 IDE. I designed the form and did the back end coding, most of which i no longer remember.

The basic logic of the application was that once opened, a while loop was initiated that went on for 7000 iterations. The only task performed in the notorious loop being, maximising and minimising the window. Since this happens too fast for anyone to respond, there is no way to stop it except using the Windows task manager.

Designed originally for our old PC having 1GB RAM and Pentuim 4 processor, this application consumed a good 10 minutes. When i tried the same on my current laptop (4 GB RAM, Core i3) i took just two minutes to exhaust.
