# Visual-Basic-Prank
A simple VB application that consumes system resources for a while before shutting down on its own (intended as a prank).

I developed this application as a prank during my school time to fool my younger brother into opening the application (which had a tempting icon for a 10 year old kid) that would use up system resources and waste his allotted time for playing on the computer.
